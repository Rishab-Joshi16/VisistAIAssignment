# AI-Powered Badminton Performance Analyzer üè∏


This project is an interactive web application as part of assignment built with Streamlit that allows users to analyze a badminton player performance dataset. Users can select from a list of frequently asked questions, and the app uses Google's Gemini API to understand the request and generate a relevant data visualization on the fly.

## Demo


*The application features a clean sidebar with FAQ-style buttons for generating charts.*
